# CommandBar

This is an illustrative example of a Spotlight-style 'command bar', like the 'Open Quickly' panel in Xcode, implemented using UIKit/Mac Catalyst.

Using the keyboard, you can navigate the results list, select an item from the list, and dismiss the popup, without losing focus in the search field.
